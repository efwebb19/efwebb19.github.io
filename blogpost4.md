<h1> The Writer's block of traveling

Choosing a travel destination is like beginning the new chapter of your book called Life.  You are about to enter a new world, and thus gain experiences and perhaps a new perspective.  When choosing where to travel, there are many factors that come into play.  You shouldn’t choose a place at the flip of a coin, much like you shouldn’t buy a book simply because the cover looks cool or someone else gave it a good review.  We all have our preferences for books, whether it be the genre, topic, or story line, and this also extends to traveling.  Before you choose your destination, consider the following:

1). Geological Preference.  This is perhaps one of the most important factors when choosing where to travel.  What region best suits your personality and hobbies?  Do you like sunbathing or mountain biking?  Snorkeling through clear Caribbean waters or hiking through the Swiss Alps?  Figure out what it is you want to be doing while on your trip and plan around that.

2). Distance and Duration.  How far away from home to you actually want to be?  Are you comfortable on a 22 hour flight, or does the sound of even a six hour flight sound daunting to you?  This can factor in how long you intend to stay as well.  If you are traveling for a couple days, recovery from jet lag might take more time out of your trip than you planned.  Similarly, if you know you have important work to do when you get back, jet lag can drastically impact your performance, and in this case, traveling closer to home would be the best option in order to get the most out of your time.

3). Cost of Living.  One of the most common traveling pitfalls I hear about is that most people don’t realize how expensive it actually is to eat regularly in another country until they are already there.  The airfare to Iceland may only be $400 round trip, which sounds nice if you are on a budget, but what happens when you get there and you realize that a regular cheeseburger from McDonalds is $25?  Be sure to do research ahead of time so you don’t find yourself in a tough spot financially.

4). Safety and Convenience.  Depending on the situation, whether your traveling alone or with a group, you should consider how safe the country you’re traveling to is.  Transportation can be tricky in some places, unsafe in many, and so it’s important to choose a destination in which transportation is easy and convenient.  Similarly, local, accessible, and populated places to eat should be an important detail when considering where to stay while traveling, otherwise stock up on provisions.

5). Make the final decision and review your choices!
